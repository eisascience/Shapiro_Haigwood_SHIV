### Summary

Transmission of HIV-1 to newborns and infants remains high, with 130,000 new infections in 2022 in resource poor settings. Half of HIV-infected newborns, if untreated, progress to disease and death within 2 years. While immunologic immaturity likely promotes pathogenesis and poor viral control, little is known about immune damage in newborns and infants. Here we examined pathologic, virologic, and immunologic outcomes in rhesus macaques exposed to pathogenic SHIV at 1-2 weeks, defined as newborns, or at 4 months of age, considered infants. Kinetics of plasma viremia and lymph node seeding DNA were indistinguishable in newborns and infants, but levels of viral DNA in gut and lymphoid tissues 6- 10 weeks post-infection were significantly higher in newborns versus either infant or adult macques.
